# akka cookbook

> I am not trying to write a book but trying to record some code snippets and answer some "HowTo"s and "WhatIs"s.

*Scala Cookbook* is an excellent book which bring me a lot, while on my way to learn Akka, I plan to record the process and share what I've learned.

Feel free to give some feedback ;)
